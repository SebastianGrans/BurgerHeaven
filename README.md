## Description 
An web interface for a burger shop with home delivery.<br>
It is equiped with both a customer front-end, as well as a restaurant front-end. <br>
The customer interface is designed with a responsive approach to be usable on mobile devices.

## Todos
When I started writing the user front-end, it felt most natural to only allow ordering once per session. But at the last stage of the lab, you asked for implementation of multi-ordering. Due to time constraints I choose not to implement this. 

There is also more to do with on the dispatch view regarding the order dots etc. 


## Bugs
* There are some bugs in the form-input where auto-fill entries don't "stick". You have to manually enter everything. 

* There are some bugs in the Prep./Dispatch/Resolve signaling system on the Customer end.
